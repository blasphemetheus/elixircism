# Elixir Exercism Track Repository
This is Bradley Fargo's repo for holding Elixir coding exercises in the exercism.io[exercism.io] Elixir track.

There's about 100 exercises and about 15 in the main track. I'm two thirds of the way done with the main track but I have done more like a third of the the extra exercises. I intend to finish all of the exercises available. It's not the most Useful work to be doing (as they are practice problems) but they sure as hell won't hurt to have done and I have nothing but time these days.

Some other projects I am thinking about:
* short term, fill bradleyfargo.com with a link to a github pages page that has up-to-date info on my life, sites and works.

* Internet Radio Audio Broadcast solution using elixir (probably using membrane)[https://github.com/membraneframework]. I used to do a radio show out of WRBB 104.9 FM in Boston under the DJ moniker Deadbeat Downer and I would like to continue broadcasting over my own tiny custom elixir platform. I'll probably use Pheonix for this and other aspects of the site and I'll host it through deadbeatdowner.com using Digital Ocean or Heroku or Google Cloud or similar.

* Some sort of publication platform with easily created and managed domains for communities that would allow freelance journalists and photographers covering local issues to publish their work online _and_ get paid for it. (Named FreeLense or similar). Necessary because of the unprecedented drought in local newspapers across the US especially. The Regional Newspaper genre has largely ceased to exist in the last decades as well, being eclipsed by National Newspapers with an active online presence.

* I vaguely need to make an indie diy mixtape but I must become better at ableton and figure out how to boot to windows virtually because I don't want to partition my perfectly good hard drive :). I'm told Kubernetes is the way.

Anyway. Thanks for reading the readme!
